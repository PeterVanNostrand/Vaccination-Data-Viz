# Visualization Backups

The following zip files are a backups of each version of the visualization in case VizHub goes down in the future. Yes I'm a data hoarder, and if you're reading this you're either very lost or share similar sensibilities.

Note: At time of writing (Dec 6th 2021) several of the later visualization have become too large for VizHub to fork. This may be corrected in the future, but if not you can duplicate the visualization by uploading one of these backups. The visualizations can also be used outside VizHub from these backups but may require bundling the JavaScript files.
